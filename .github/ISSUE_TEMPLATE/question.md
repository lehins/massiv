about: Ask a question about massiv and related
---

If you would like to ask a simple question about the usage of massiv, it is better to do so on
https://gitter.im/haskell-massiv, where people who are more keen to answer such questions will
be notified, instead of everyone who is watching the repository for new features and bug reports.

In case when a question is more complicated and/or more people in the community would benefit from
an answer, naturally https://stackoverflow.com would be a more suitable place. Make sure to tag a
question with `massiv` and possibly paste a link on gitter.

If you still believe you will reach the right audience by asking a question here on github, please,
feel free to do so.
